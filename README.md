# Discord Bot
## By Victor Nguyen

Hello to whoever is reading this!  This is a Discord bot that is still in progress!  The bot was programmed using Python3.  The whole idea to create a Discord bot was inspired by my boredom being stuck inside due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  While I'm stuck inside I thought it could be useful to learn a new programming language and I came to the conclusion in learning Python due to its vast usage in the real world.  The original intention of the Discord bot is determine your words per minute(WPM) by giving you a task of typing 50 random words as fast as you can.  As time passed I came up with more ideas for my Discord bot than just determining WPM.
